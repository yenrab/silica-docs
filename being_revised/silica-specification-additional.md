## 1. Scope

This specification defines additional compiler rules that cause **hard errors** at compile time. These patterns are anti-patterns that other languages allow (often with optimizer remediation); Silica rejects them outright. The compiler must fail with an error when any of these patterns are detected.

---

## 2. Design Rationale

Rather than optimizing away inefficient or redundant code, Silica enforces that programmers write efficient code by design. Patterns that would traditionally be fixed by optimization passes are instead rejected at compile time. This reduces reliance on optimizer heuristics and makes program behavior more predictable.

## 3. Compiler Failure Rules

### 3.1 Unused Bindings (Dead Code)

**Rule**: A `let` binding whose variable is never used is a compile error.

**Anti-pattern**: Dead code; bindings that serve no purpose.

**Error message**: "Unused binding: `<name>` — remove it or use it."

**Applies to**: SIR `let` terms and equivalent source-level bindings.

---

### 3.2 Duplicate Computation (CSE)

**Rule**: Computing the same expression twice in the same scope with the same inputs is a compile error.

**Anti-pattern**: Duplicate subexpressions; the programmer should bind once and reuse.

**Error message**: "Duplicate computation: same expression appears twice — bind to a variable and reuse."

**Applies to**: SIR terms where identical expressions (same structure, same free variables) appear in the same scope.

---

### 3.3 Redundant Algebraic Operations

**Rule**: Redundant algebraic operations are compile errors.

**Anti-pattern**: Operations that have no effect: `x * 1`, `x + 0`, `x - 0`, `x * 0`, `x & 0`, `x | ~0`, etc.

**Error message**: "Redundant operation: `<expr>` — simplify to `<simplified>`."

**Applies to**: `prim` operations on SIR; equivalent source-level expressions.

**Examples**:
- `x * 1` → error: use `x`
- `x + 0` or `x - 0` → error: use `x`
- `x * 0` → error: use `0` (and review: the computation of `x` may be dead)
- `x & 0` → error: use `0`
- `x | ~0` → error: use `~0`

---

### 3.4 Invariant Guards in Case Expressions

**Rule**: A guard in a `case` expression that does not depend on any pattern bindings is a compile error.

**Anti-pattern**: Guards that could be evaluated before the case; the programmer should restructure.

**Error message**: "Guard does not depend on pattern bindings — move it before the case or restructure."

**Applies to**: SIR `case` terms; source-level `case` expressions with guards.

---

### 3.5 Loop-Invariant Code

**Rule**: An expression inside a loop (or tail-recursive body) that does not depend on any loop variables is a compile error.

**Anti-pattern**: Loop-invariant computations; the programmer should move them outside the loop.

**Error message**: "Loop-invariant expression — move outside the loop."

**Applies to**: Implicit loops formed by tail recursion; any recursive body where the expression does not depend on the recursive parameter or values derived from it.

---

### 3.6 Constant Hoisting (Loop Invariants)

**Rule**: A constant expression (or pure expression with no loop dependencies) inside a loop body is a compile error.

**Anti-pattern**: Constants recomputed every iteration; the programmer should hoist them.

**Error message**: "Constant expression in loop body — move outside the loop."

**Applies to**: Same context as §3.5; overlaps with loop-invariant but specifically targets constant literals and pure expressions.

---

### 3.7 Redundant Constant Expressions

**Rule**: Literal constant expressions that can be simplified to a single constant are compile errors.

**Anti-pattern**: Writing `2 + 3` instead of `5`, or `1 * x` instead of `x`; the programmer should write the minimal form.

**Error message**: "Redundant constant expression: `<expr>` — use `<minimal>`."

**Applies to**: SIR `const` and `prim` when all operands are constants; source-level literal arithmetic.

**Examples**:
- `2 + 3` → error: use `5`
- `1 * x` (when `1` is literal) → error: use `x`

---

### 3.8 Strength Reduction (Multiply by Power of Two)

**Rule**: Multiplying by a literal power of two (e.g. `x * 8`) is a compile error; use a shift instead.

**Anti-pattern**: Obscuring intent; the programmer should use the explicit shift for clarity and to avoid relying on optimizer strength reduction.

**Error message**: "Multiply by power of two — use shift: `<expr>` → `<shift_expr>`."

**Applies to**: `prim` multiply with literal power-of-two operand; source-level multiplication.

**Examples**:
- `x * 8` → error: use `x << 3`
- `x * 16` → error: use `x << 4`

---

## 4. Implementation Notes

1. **Detection phase**: These checks run during or after SIR construction, before optimization passes that would have previously remediated them.
2. **Diagnostics**: Each error should suggest the fix (e.g. "move outside the loop", "use shift").
3. **No escape hatches**: These are hard errors. There are no pragmas or attributes to disable them.
4. **Order of application**: Dead code, CSE, and algebraic checks can run on SIR. Loop-invariant and guard-invariant checks require control-flow analysis (tail recursion structure, case structure).
